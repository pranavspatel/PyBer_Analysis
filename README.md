# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis


PyBer operates in three types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. Previously, we analyzed the ride count, average fare per ride, and average number of drivers, all categorized by the type of city.Moreover, we compared each city's metrics and the average ride fare to the total number of rides per city. For this challenge, we took it a step further and created a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver and the multiple line plot.

Our purpose is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.


## Results


From the summary data frame we can say that there is a direct relation between the population of the city and the total number of rides which impacts the total number of drivers, total fare, and both averages. As the distance from the urban area increases the average fare per ride and per driver seems to increase. But, less drivers in rural areas may lead to a higher average fare per ride and driver, as prices increase when supply is low.



From the Multi-line graph we can see that the average fare price is higher for the whole year in the urban area compared to the suburban and rural cities.




## Summary

1. There is an sharp increase in the price in the month of April in the suburban cities.
2. Average fare per ride is higher when there are less drivers.
3. Company may want ot allocate more drivers to the rural areas so that the price per fare can be stabilized.
